				<h2>About New Wave Music</h2>

				<p>In this rapidly changing world, music has expanded with no limits in sight. The amount of genres and sub genres makes finding the right sound complicated. While streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music offer endless amounts of music, the spotligh still remains on the highest grossing artists regardless of talent. New Wave Music is home to those that seek further than the top 100, and want to step out of their comfort zone to try new sounds from all around the world.</p>

				<p>Here at New Wave Music we have big plans to shake up the way music is discovered, and offer a less regulated platform for users to find the sound they are looking for. We fully support artist-focused platforms like SoundCloud in their drive to give artist a place to share songs under their own control. New Wave Music hopes to play a roll in giving the power to the artist by allowing artist to weigh in on how their music is marketed, distributed, and interpreted.</p>
